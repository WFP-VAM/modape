The [MODIS processing chain](../#overview) can be executed at a high level using CLI scrips with minimal user input. All of the scripts are created using the Python module [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/).

!!! Warning
    `modis_collect`, `modis_smooth` and `modis_window` are only implemented for
    MOD/MYD 11/13 products!

### `modis_download`

With `modis_download` you can query and download MODIS raw data.

!!! Note
    Downloading NASA data to local disk requires valid [Earthdata credentials](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/).

The products to be queried for need to be supplied as a list of MODIS product IDs (case insensitive), each item separated by a single space, e.g. `MOD13A2 MYD11A1 ...`.

!!! Tip
    If you want to query for both MODIS satellites for the same product, the letter indicating which satellite can be replaced by a `?`, e.g. `M?d13A2`.

The query can be limited by coordinates (as `--roi` point or bounding box), MODIS tile IDs (supplied as comma separated list to `--tile-filter`, e.g `h20v08,h20v09`) and a date bracket (supplied to `--begin-date` and `--end-date`). Due to the nature of composited products, results can be returned slightly outside the specified date bracket. To avoid this and match the start date to the MODIS timestamp, pass the `--match-begin` flag.

The query is sent to the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) using the [`python-cmr`](https://github.com/jddeal/python-cmr) module.

!!! Tip
    To look at the details of the returned results, pass the `--print-results` flag.

The download is only performed when both credential flags are passed (`--username` & `--password`) as well as the `--download` flag. By default, the download is performed sequentially using Python's `requests`.

!!! Tip
    To speed up the download, you may use multiple threads (`--multithread`) where the number of used threads can be adjusted with the `--nthreads` flag (default is 4 threads).

When the `--robust` flag is passed, each downloaded HDF file will undergo a check for file size and checksum and is then compared to NASA's specifications.

MODAPE will try to download each HDF file with 5 tries separated by an increasing backoff factor inside of a re-try loop. The number of re-tries can be specified with `--max-retries`. By default, there's no limit to the number of retries.

!!! Warning
    If no limit to `--max-retries` is set, MODAPE will remain in an infinite re-try loop until all scheduled downloads were successful. Due to the increasing backoff factor, the tries will happen with increasing time in between, avoiding flooding the data server.

A processing chain might require the target directory to not contain any previous HDF files, which can be enforced using `--target-empty`. By default, existing files won't be overwritten. If this is required, pass the `--overwrite` flag.

### `modis_collect`

Before applying the Whittake smoother to the data, the raw HDF files need to be collected into a 3D spatio-temporal cube inside an HDF5 file, using `modis_collect`.

The only required input is `src_dir`, a directory with the raw MODIS HDF files to be collected. These can be multiple products and tiles.

If no target directory (`--target-dir`) is specified, the output will be stored in the `src_dir`. The HDF5 files themselves get stored in a sub-directory, which is attributed to the extracted parameter (indicated by the VAM parameter code). This needs to be considered carefully, as updating the existing files depends on the executable being able to locate them.

To extract a specific parameter, a [VAM parameter code](../#vam-parameter-codes) can be specified using `--vam-code`. If not specified, the defaults will be extracted, which are NDVI (VIM) and LST Daytime (TDA/TDT).

In the case of 16 day MODIS NDVI products, both satellites can be interleaved to form a combined 8-day product, indicated by a new _MXD_ product code. Each combination of MODIS product and tile get collected into the same HDF5 file.

!!! Tip
    Using `--parallel-tiles`, these can be collected in parallel (up to 4 collection processes). If an HDF5 file does not exist, it will be created, otherwise updated with the new data.

It might be required to perform a check on temporal continuity, which can be done using `--last-collected`. Here a MODIS julian date can be specified that needs to be the last timestep collected before the new collection starts. If that's not the case, the process will fail on exception.

With the `--tiles-required` option, a comma separated list of tiles (e.g `h20v08,h20v09,...`) can be specified which are the required set of tiles to be collected. `modis_collect` will check if all tiles are present in the input files, and if they contain the same timeps. If either more or less tiles are present, or if the timesteps between the tiles differes, the script will raise an exception.

!!! Danger
    It's the user's responsibility to ensure temporal continuity when creating and updating files. New timesteps are simply appended, only checking if they don't precede existing ones. There are no further checks if a timestep might be missing etc. This follows the "garbage in - garbage out" principle.

```

### `modis_smooth`

This step applies the Whittaker smoother to the raw data. The input (`src`) can be either a single raw HDF5 file, or a directory containing multiple.

There's a one-to-many relationship between raw and smooth HDF5 files. One raw file can have multiple smooth files, depending on the settings used for smoothing. As with the raw HDF5 files, the smooth files get created if they don't exist or updated if they do. So it's again crucial to be aware of where the data gets written to, and adjust accordingly with `--targetdir`.

The smoothing can be performed in multiple ways, which is determined by the user's input:

- if the `--soptimize` flag is passed, the V-curve optimization of the smoothing parameter S is performed. This always takes precedence over other methods, independent of other inputs supplied.
- if `--soptimize` is passed alongside a P value (`--pvalue`), then an asymmetric V-curve optimization is performed using the supplied P value.
- if only the S Value (`--svalue`) is supplied, then the smoothing is performed using a fixed S (as supplied - should be in log10)
- if none of the above is supplied, the smoothing will be performed reading S values from a previously optimized S-grid. **Note:** This requires that `--soptimize` has been run at least once previously.

The V-curve optimization will look for an optimized S value for each pixel within a given range. This range can be defined using the `--srange` flag (expects 3 space separated log10 values). If the range is not supplied, the algorithm will use one of two for each pixel, depending on the lag-1 correlation of the pixel's timeseries:

- lag-1 correlation > 0.5: `smin=-2`, `smax=1`, `sstep=0.2`
- lag-1 correlation <= 0.5: `smin=0`, `smax=3`, `sstep=0.2`

The smoother can also perform temporal interpolation, to a desired temporal grid. The desired timestep should be defined with `--tempint`. Dekad (10-day) and pentad (5-day) interpolation follow a fixed date cycle. For other more custom interpolations, it's required to specify a start date (`--tempint-start`) from which the timestep will be calculated.

For subsequent runs after optimization, the number of timesteps used for smoothing (`--nsmooth`) and the number updated in the target dataset (`--nupdate`) can be limited to speed up the process.

Similar to raw HDF5 files, the `--last-collected` flag can be passed to enforce a check on the last raw date used for smoothing in the previous run.


#### Usage

  -d, --targetdir PATH            Target directory for smoothed output

```

### `modis_window`

`modis_window` enables the export of data from HDF5 files as GeoTIFF. The data can be a mosaic of many tiles, or a subset of a single tile / global file.

The input (`src`) can be a single HDF5 file or a directory containing multiple files. In the second case, the input can be filtered by MODIS product (`--filter-product`) and VAM parameter code (`--filter-vampc`).

For subsets, a region of interest (`--roi`) needs to be specified as comma separated list. The exported dates can be limited by passing a date bracket. (`--begin-date` & `--end-date`).

In case of smooth HDF5 files, the grid containing the V-curve optimized S values for each pixel can be exported by passing the `--sgrid` flag. In this case any input dates won't have an effect (there's only one S-grid).

If outputs in the MODIS Sinusoidal projection are warped by default to `EPSG:4326`. For warping to a different spatial reference, specify a `GDAL` readable reference to `--target-srs`.

!!! Note
    Only tiled MODIS products are in Sinusoidal projection. The global 5km products are already in `EPSG:4326` and don't need to be warped.

By default, all exported GeoTIFFs get compressed using `LZW` with predictor 2 (using the creation options `["COMPRESS=LZW", "PREDICTOR=2"]`). To specify different `GDAL` creation options, a space separated list in form of `KEY=VALUE` can be passed to `--co`.


!!! Tip
    To further improve the compression and reduce file size, the data can be rounded to a significant integer. E.g. a NDVI value of `3141` can be rounded to `3100` by passing `2` to `--round-int`.

!!! Tip
    For further customization of the exported GeoTIFFs, additional GDAL options can be supplied to `--gdal-kwarg` in the same format.


The file naming for exported GeoTIFFs is detailed in the [main documentation](../#exported-geotiffs). A custom region code can be specified using `--region`. When exporting dekad / pentad data, `--force-doy` can be used to force a `YYYYjDDD` timestamp instead of the dekad / pentad format.

!!! Note
    Note: please read the section in the main documentation carefully to avoid confusion with identical named GeoTIFFs.

By default existing GeoTIFFs won't be overwritten. This can be forced with passwing the `--overwrite` flag.
