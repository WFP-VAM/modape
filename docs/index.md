# MODIS Assimilation and Processing Engine

The MODIS Assimilation and Processing Engine (modape) is a python based smoothing engine for MODIS data, combining a state-of-the art Whittaker smoother with a fast processing chain for handling MODIS data.

## Main features


Whittaker smoother:

- Whittaker with 2nd order differences
- fast implementation with Cython
- Pixel-wise optimization of the smoothing paramter using the V-curve
- V-curve optimization with expectile smoothing using asymmetric weights
- User defined temporal interpolation


MODIS processing chain:

- Easy query and download of MODIS products
- Collection of raw data into daily HDF5 files for fast processing
- Automatic interleaving of MOD13 and MYD13 products
- Fast smoothing, gapfilling and temporal interpolation
- Extraction of mosaics and subsets from smoothed data as GeoTIFFs in GCS WGS1984

## Installation

Dependencies:

modape depends on these packages:

- numpy
- gdal
- h5py
- beautifulsoup4
- requests
- pandas

Some of these packages (eg. GDAL) can be difficult to build, especially on windows machines. In the latter case it's advisable to download an unofficial binary wheel from [Christoph Gohlke's Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install it locally with ``pip install`` before installing modape.

**Installation from github:**



    $ git clone https://github.com/WFP-VAM/modape
    $ cd modape
    $ pip install .

**Installation from PyPi:**



    $ pip install modape


## Executables

The modape module features some executables, which are mainly for handling and smoothing MODIS data, as well as smoothing arbitrary raster timeseries and pixel timeseries inside CSV files.

### modis_download

**Description:**

Query and download MODIS data using product ID(s).

For querying/downloading tile-based MODIS product, a region of interest as `--roi` or a MODIS tile ID as `--tile-filter` is required. The ROI can be either a point location, with latitude and longitude, a bounding box with lower left x/y and upper right x/y coordinates or an OGR file (shp, geojson) in which case the convex hull of the features will be used.

Querying and downloading global MODIS products (5km) does not require a region of interest.

If both MOD and MYD products are required, using M?D will query/download both MODIS Aqua and Terra.

Multiple product IDs can be queried and downloaded at the same time. They need to be separated by space (e.g. MOD13A2 MOD11A1)

Downloading data requires valid Earthdata user credentials (register at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new). The download can be performed with Python's request module (default), or with ARIA2 by adding `--aria2` (ARIA2 must be available in PATH - this option can be faster for global or a big number of products).

The products are downloaded by default to the current working directory, if no target directory has been supplied by specifying `-d, --targetdir`.

```

**Usage example:**

### modis_collect

**Description:**

Collect raw MODIS hdf files into raw daily HDF5 files for further processing.

After downloading raw MODIS files, they need to be collected into an HDF5 file for smoothing.

For MODIS vegetation products, 16-day TERRA (MOD) and AQUA (MYD) products can be interleaved to a combined 8-day product (MXD) if the `--interleave` flag is added.

For continuous processing chain, the target directory should remain constant. If the processed HDF5 file already exists, the new raw data is ingested at the correct place, otherwise a new file is created.

The HDF5 files are created in a subdirectory of the target directory (default current working directory), VIM and LTD for vegetation indices and land surface temperature, respectively.

The only mandatory input is `srcdir`, the directory containing the raw hdf files to be processed.

Currently processing is implemented for MODIS vegetation and MODIS LST products. By default, NDVI and LST_Day will be extracted and processed from the raw hdf files. Additionally all parameters (EVI, LST_Night) can be extracted too by adding `--all-vampc`.

The default blocksize for processing is set to (). When specifying a custom blocksize, make sure the number of rows and columns divides evenly by the respective blocksize!


**modis_collect help:**

```
$ modis_collect -h

usage: modis_collect [-h] [-d] [-x] [--all-vampc] [-c] [--interleave] [--parallel-tiles] [--quiet] srcdir

positional arguments:
  srcdir               directory with raw MODIS .hdf files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -d , --targetdir     Target directory for PROCESSED MODIS files (default is scrdir)
  -x , --compression   Compression for HDF5 files
  -c , --chunksize     Number of pixels per block (value needs to result in integer number of blocks)
  --all-vampc          Flag to process all possible VAM product codes
  --interleave         Interleave MOD13 & MYD13 products to MXD (only works for VIM!)
  --parallel-tiles     Number of tiles processed in parallel (default = None)
  --quiet              Be quiet
```
**Usage example:**

![modis_collect]

### modis_smooth

**Description:**

Smooth, gapfill and interpolate raw MODIS HDF5 files.

As mandatory input, raw MODIS HDF5 files (as processed by `modis_collect`) are smoothed, gapfilled and interpolated, using a whittaker filter with 2nd order differences.

By default, the standard whittaker smoother will be applied, and if no `s` value is provided (to be provided as `log10(s)` - e.g. 0.1), the function will read a pixel based `s` value from the s-grid.

If the `--optv` flag is set, the `s` value will be per-pixel optimized using the V-curve, and the resulting values stored as s-grid.

If `--optvp` is set, expectile smoothing with V-curve optimization is performed. The results of the optimized `s` are again stored as s-grid.

The smoothed dataset can be interpolated to any integer timestep by passing `-t, --tempint` to the function. For pentadal (t = 5) and dekadal (p = 10) interpolation, the resulting dates are fixed. Any other custom temporal interpolation can be achieved by specifying a start date (`--startdate`) and a corresponding temporal interval (`--t, --tempint`).
If no value is set, no interpolation is performed and the smoothed data will have the same temporal resolution as the raw data.

If a smoothed HDF5 already exists in the target directory, it will be updated, otherwise a new one will be created.

If not all raw timesteps should be used for smoothing, or if not all smoothed timesteps should be written back to disk, this can be controlled by specifying `-n, --nsmooth` and `-u, --nupdate` respectively.

By default, the smoothing will be processed in serial. To leverage parallel processing, tiles can be processed in parallel by supplying a number to `--parallel-tiles`. Additionally, each tile can be processed using multiple worker processes, by supplying a number of workers to `--nworkers`.

Naming convention for smoothed HDF5 files:

_ProductID . Tile ID . Version number . VAM product code . Temporal flag_

e.g. MXD13A2.h18v04.006.VIM.txn.h5

The temporal flag can have the following values:
- txn: native temporal resolution
- txp: pentadal (5-daily) data
- txd: dekadal (10 daily) data
- txc: custom interpolation (user input)

```
**Usage example:**

### modis_window

**Description:**

Create mosaics (or subsets) from smoothed MODIS HDF5 files.

Given a directory containing smoothed MODIS HDF5 files `path`, this tool creates mosaics or subsets of smoothed data, depending on the input.

The desired product can be specified with the `-p, --product flag`.

For tile-based products, specifying a region of interest is mandatory. If a point location is specified, the entire intersecting tile will be used as window. If a bounding box is specified, multiple tiles of the same product will be mosaicked. If the bounding box is smaller than one tile, a subset of the intersecting tile will be created.

For global MODIS products, no region of interest is required. If a bounding box is specified, a subset of the global product is returned as window.

The time range required can be controlled with `-b, --begin-date` and `-e, --end-date` where the input should be a date in the format YYYYMM (e.g. 201808).

Adding the `--sgrid` flag will extract or mosaic the s-grid rather than the smoothed data.

All mosaics/subsets will be saved to the target directory (default current working directory) as GeoTIFF files, in a geographic coordinate system (EPSG:4326 - WGS84) with the naming convention:

_REGION VPC yyyyjddd_

e.g. regvim2018j169.tif

where REGION should be a three letter code for the region (can be defined with `--region`, default is "reg"), VPC is the VAM product code and yyyyjddd is the julian date of the image.

```
**Usage example:**

![modis_product_table]

### rts_smooth

**Description:**

Smooth and gapfill local raster timeseries which is located in `path`.

If no `-P, --pattern` is specified, the function assumes that only rasters belonging to the timeseries are in the `path` directory.

The user has to make sure that the rasters, which define the timeseries, have a file naming that puts them in the right order when applying a simple sort to the filenames.

Nodata values can be specified using the `--nodata` flag. If none is specified, the function will try to read it from input. If that fails, nodata is assumed to be 0.

The resulting smoothed raster files have the same naming as the input files, and will be saved to disk in a subfolder corresponding to the smoothing method applied, in the target directory (default is current working directory).

Additionally, a config.txt file is saved to disk with the smoothing parameters.

If s-optimization is selected, the resulting s-grid is also saved to disk.

The subdirectories are:

- _./filt0_ for fixed s
- _./filtoptv_ for s-optimization
- _./filtoptvp_ for s-optimization and expectile smoothing

The smoothing currently only runs sequential, so big timeseries or big raster datasets can take some time!

**rts_smooth help:**

```
$ rts_smooth -h

```

**Usage example:**

![rts_smooth]


### csv_smooth

**Description:**

Smooth pixel-timeseries from a CSV file.

The CSV file for `file` is expected to have a specific naming convention and structure:

The first three letters of the filename are expected to be the region code and will be included in the output name.

The first row is skipped by default.

The first column is reserved for metadata, the first 3 rows of the first columns are "ID", "Lon", "Lat".

All columns starting number two are considered separate pixel timeseries, where each timeseries should start with an ID, and with the 2 coordinates lon and lat.

Example:

| -      	| -          	| -          	| -          	|
|--------	|------------	|------------	|------------	|
| ID     	| Location 1 	| Location 2 	| Location n 	|
| Lon    	| 25.65      	| 26.75      	| ...        	|
| Lat    	| 7.92       	| 7.78       	| ...        	|
| Date 1 	| 0.62       	| 0.62       	| ...        	|
| Date 2 	| 0.62       	| 0.56       	| ...        	|
| Date 3 	| 0.65       	| 0.5        	| ...        	|
| ...    	| ...        	| ...        	| ...        	|

The output is saved to CSV in the same directory as the input.

The filename of the output is combined of region code (first three letters) and smoothing method:

- _filt0.csv_ : for fixed s
- _filtoptv.csv_ : for s-optimized
- _filtoptvp.csv_ : for s-optimized with expectile

The optimal s (sopt) and log10(sopt) are appended to each column, if a fixed s is chosen, it's assumed to be sopt.

If expectile smoothing is chosen, the p value is also be appended.
